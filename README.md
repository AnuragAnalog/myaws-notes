# AWS Notes

A repository that contains all the AWS Content which I have learned

## Setup

### CLI

Before running any of the CLI commands to use the AWS resources, we need to first install and configure the AWS CLI.

You can find the installation instructions at [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

### Python

To interact with the AWS, via Python, you have to install `boto3`

```bash
$ pip3 install boto3
```
